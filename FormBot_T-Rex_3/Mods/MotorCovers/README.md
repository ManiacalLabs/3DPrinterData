The stock X-Axis motor covers for the T-Rex 3 are problematic.
For one they don't always fit when doing the 2+ to 3.0 upgrade.
But also they have extremely limited tensioning range and if you go too far it just pinches the belt between the idler and the side of the cover.

This mod opens up the top and side to allow for better tensioning and opens up the back a bit so it actually *fits* on the printer. Only have my one printer as an example, but see no reason why this wouldn't work on any T-Rex 3.0

Note: The M4 bolt used for tensioning is no longer recessed and you should use a washer to provide more contact area and strength.
